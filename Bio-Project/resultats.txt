Number of blocs that we will be analysing from E. Coli = 2630
Number of blocs that we will be analysing from Vibrio Cholerae = 1632
Histogram with the distribution of GC in each bloc, uncomment to see graphics.
Creation of FASTA file for submission at NCBI's glimmer tool for Vibrio Cholerae
12 = Length of the ORFs
Creation of FASTA file with coding genes and another FASTA file for non-coding genes for Vibrio Cholerae
Updating FASTA file with coding genes and adding percentage in GC nucleotides
Histogram with the distribution of GC in each coding gene for Vibrio Cholerae, uncomment to see graphic
Now we do everything we need to do to compare it to E. Coli, we will be using the tab file
	Creation of FASTA file with coding genes and another for non-coding genes for E. Coli
	Updating FASTA file with coding genes and adding percentage in GC nucleotides
	Histogram with the distribution of GC in each coding gene for E. Coli, uncomment to see graphic
Cleaning up
Calculating lengths of ORFs from the Glimmer file for Vibrio Cholerae, uncomment to see graphics
Calculating lengths from tab file of Vibrio Cholerae
We do the same thing for E. Coli, uncomment to see graphics
	Calculating lengths of ORFs from the Glimmer file for E. Coli, uncomment to see graphics
Creating binary list from the Glimmer file of Vibrio Cholerae and its genome
Creating binary list from the .tab file of Vibrio Cholerae and its genome
Comparing both glimmer and tab binaries:
	True negatives: 346824
	False positives: 32818
	False negatives: 70459
	True positives: 2511048
And lastly, we look at the sensitivity and the specifity:
